# Scala-Java
This is my repository to learn Java and Scala core features e.g. functional programming,lambdas,streams,i/o,concurrency. It contains Scala and Java random comparisons, usages of libraries and some other absolutely random (often idiotic) lines of code. Project is built using sbt and is actually Scala project with Java additions.
